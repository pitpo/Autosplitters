LiveSplit.GTA3.asl - zoton's GTA 3 autosplitter configured to satisfy my needs (100% is currently broken, i'm to lazy to fix it)
LiveSplit.GTAVC.asl - zoton's Vice City autosplitter configured to satisfy my needs

LiveSplit.Mafia.asl - Mafia autosplitter and load remover, it splits for every mission so try not to load previous ones (like why the heck would you even want to do that)
It should work on every 1.0 version
